Design and implement a class called Sphere  that contains instance data that represents the sphereâ€™s diameter.
Define the Sphere constructor to accept and initialize the diameter,  and include getter  and setter  methods for the diameter. Include methods calcVolume  and calcSurfaceArea that calculate and return the volume and surface area of the sphere. 
Include a toString  method that returns a one-line description of the sphere in this form:


A sphere with diameter X has surface area Y and volume Z.

  where X  is the object's diameter rounded to 3 decimal places
  where Y  is the object's surface area rounded to 3 decimal places
  where Z  is the object's volume rounded to 3 decimal places

Define 2 additonal methods to calculate the following formulas in your class. Name them calcVolume and calcSurfaceArea:

Volume = 4/3 PI times cube of the radius

Surface Area = 4 PI times the square of the radius


SPECIFICATIONS FOR PROMPTS:
```
Enter diameter:
```

SPECIFICATIONS FOR OUTPUT:
```
A sphere with diameter 0.### has surface area: 0.### and volume: 0.###
```

EXAMPLE:
```
MacBook-Pro-2:Chap04 danwooster$ java TestSphere
Enter diameter: 43.2
A sphere with diameter 43.2 has surface area: 5862.966 and volume: 42213.354.
